# Python Practice

A collection of beginner-friendly Python examples, exercises, and small projects used for hands-on practice and learning.

Contents
--------
- Python_Basics.ipynb — main Jupyter notebook with tutorial sections and exercises (variables, strings, lists, loops, functions, and more).

Getting Started
---------------
1. Install Python (3.8+ recommended): https://www.python.org/
2. Install Jupyter or use VS Code's Jupyter support:

	- To install Jupyter: `pip install jupyter`
	- Start the notebook: `jupyter notebook` or open the workspace in VS Code and open the `.ipynb` file.

What you'll find
-----------------
- Step-by-step annotated examples that cover Python basics.
- Short exercises such as even/odd separation, multiplication tables, and a guess-the-number game.
- Practical usage examples showing input/output and simple control flow.
 
## OOP Notebooks and Assignments

- `OOP.ipynb` — an interactive Jupyter notebook that covers Object-Oriented Programming topics with examples and exercises. Main sections include:
	- Basic Class and Object
	- Class Method and `self`
	- Inheritance
	- Encapsulation (public/protected/private attributes)
	- Polymorphism
	- Class Variables
	- Static Methods
	- Property Decorators
	- Class Inheritance and `isinstance()`
	- Multiple Inheritance

	Open this notebook in Jupyter or VS Code to run cells interactively: [OOP.ipynb](OOP.ipynb)

- `OOP_Major Assignment.py` — a Python script containing the major assignment for the OOP section (exercises, example implementations, and test runs). Open or run it with Python to execute the included examples: [OOP_Major Assignment.py](OOP_Major%20Assignment.py)

Usage
-----
- Open [Python_Basics.ipynb](Python_Basics.ipynb) in Jupyter or VS Code and run cells interactively.
- No external dependencies beyond the Python standard library for the included examples.
